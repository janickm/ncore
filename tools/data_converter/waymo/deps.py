Proxy module for Waymo Open Dataset dependencies.

There are potential conflicts between protobuf versions incorporated as an (outdated)
tensorflow dependency, and the actual ones we'd like to use directly from the proto rules.
This module removes the internal ones (which have a <pip-hub>_<pyversion>_protobuf_... path
component) to avoid conflicts.
