class Rectificator:
    """Maps imagery from a source camera into a target camera's image domain

    Rectification is a generic "from-camera -> to-camera" intrinsic remap within a shared
    camera frame. The most common use is mapping a distorted source camera to a
    distortion-free (ideal pinhole) target, but the target may itself be distorted.

    On construction a backward sample map (target -> source direction) is built once:
    for every target pixel, the corresponding ray is unprojected with the target model
    and re-projected with the source model, giving the source image coordinate to sample
    from. Resampling a source image into the target domain is then a single gather /
    interpolation (:meth:`apply`). The raw map (:attr:`sample_map`, :attr:`valid_mask`)
    is exposed so callers can run their own (e.g. GPU or OpenCV) resampling.
