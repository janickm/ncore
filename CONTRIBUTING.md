# How to Contribute

We'd love to receive your patches and contributions to NCore. Please keep your PRs as draft until you're ready for review.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

## Development Setup

### Install System Packages

In addition to nvidia drivers / cuda runtime (>11.1), the following system packages should be installed to build all parts of the project:

```bash
sudo apt-get install pandoc
```

Additionally, the following packages should be installed as dependencies for tools:

```bash
sudo apt-get install qt6-base-dev libxcb-cursor0
```

### Setup GitHub Personal Access Token / Docker Credentials

Create a github personal access token with `read:packages` scope at [create-new-token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and register the new token in `~/.netrc` file as

```netrc
machine maven.pkg.github.com
  login <GITHUB_USER>
  password <GITHUB_TOKEN>
```

by replacing `<GITHUB_USER>` with the user-name and `<GITHUB_TOKEN>` with the created token string.

[one-time operation]

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/ncore.git
```

### Install Bazel

The repository uses `bazel` as the core build-system (see `.bazelversion` for the required version).

The correct `bazel` version is most easily invoked using the official `bazelisk` wrapper.

`bazelisk` can be installed with one of the methods listed at [bazelisk-installation](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk#installation), or simply by running:

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/bazel https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/latest/download/bazelisk-linux-amd64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bazel
```

### Build and Test

```bash
# Build all targets
bazel build //...

# Run tests
bazel test //...
```

## Coding Guidelines

### Formatting

Format all code before submitting:

```bash
# Format all files
bazel run //:format

# Check for violations (used in CI)
bazel run //:format.check
```

This project uses:

- **Python**: Ruff (120 character line length)
- **Bazel files**: Buildifier

Note a special case for Bazel: the commands above are used both for traditional formatting and for linter warnings. Bazel attempts to fix some of the linter warnings automatically as part of the `//:format` target, but others will be left untouched and need to be manually corrected by the user.

### Static Type Checking

All Python code is checked with `mypy`, which runs automatically as a Bazel aspect during builds.

#### Speeding Up Local mypy Execution

The repository makes use of `mypy` for static-code validation of the important components. These are executed as part of aspects associated with all python targets. In order to speed up _local_ execution of `mypy`, consider making use of a _persistent_ user-cache available to `mypy` (as due to the way bazel sandboxes are setup, `mypy` is not able to access an external cache folder for faster analysis).

To enable separate local mypy caching, we are using a patched version which enables using local cache folders, which can be enabled by setting

```bazel
# Make use of local mypy cache
build --sandbox_writable_path=<ABSOLUTE-PATH-TO>/.mypy_cache
build --action_env=MYPY_CACHE_DIR=<ABSOLUTE-PATH-TO>/.mypy_cache
```

in `.bazelrc.user`.

Without these options there will be no caching of intermediate incremental mypy results (bazel caching of final test states is not affected by this and still active before).

### License Headers

All source files must include SPDX license headers:

### Commit Messages

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. All commits must follow this format:

```text
<type>[optional (scope)]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

With optional [breaking-change indicators](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#commit-message-with--to-draw-attention-to-breaking-change).

**Common types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

Commit messages are validated in CI using [cocogitto](https://github.com/cocogitto/cocogitto). PRs with non-compliant commits or merge commits will fail the conventional commits check.

### Branch Naming

Branches must follow the naming pattern:

```text
<type>/<username>/<topic>
```

Where:

- `<type>` is a conventional commit type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `dev`)
- `<username>` is your GitHub username or identifier
- `<topic>` is a short, descriptive name for the change (use hyphens for spaces)

### Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused and concise; address a _single_ atomic concern per PR
- Avoid committing commented-out code
- Ensure the CI passes with no warnings or errors
- Ensure library versions are updated appropriately for changing public-facing APIs
- Include full test coverage for new or updated functionality

### Linear History

This repository enforces a **linear commit history** of commits with conventional commit messages.

PRs are merged via **rebase only** (no merge commits).

Before submitting your PR, ensure your branch is *rebased* on the latest `main` and is free of merge commits.

## Releases & Versioning

NCore uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with versions determined automatically from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) via [cocogitto](https://docs.cocogitto.io/).

### Version Source of Truth

The package version is **not hardcoded** in any source file. Instead, it is injected at build time via Bazel's `--embed_label` flag:

```bash
# Local development (uses default 0.0.0.dev0 from .bazelrc):
bazelisk build //ncore:ncore_wheel

# Explicit version:
bazelisk build --embed_label=18.6.0 //ncore:ncore_wheel

# Build + publish (CI):
bazelisk run --stamp --embed_label=18.6.0 //ncore:ncore_wheel.publish
```

Git tags (e.g., `v18.5.0`) are the single source of truth for released versions.

### Release Process

Releases are managed by GitHub Actions workflows:

1. An admin triggers the **Prepare Release** workflow (`release.yml`) via `workflow_dispatch`
2. The workflow computes the next version from conventional commits since the last tag
3. A release PR is created with an updated `CHANGELOG.md`
4. The admin reviews and merges the PR
5. CI detects the release commit, creates a git tag, publishes the wheel, and creates a GitHub Release

### Dev Builds

On-demand development builds can be created via the **Dev Build** workflow (`dev-build.yml`):

1. An admin triggers the workflow via `workflow_dispatch`
2. The version is computed from `git describe` (e.g., `18.5.0.dev7` for 7 commits after `v18.5.0`)
3. The wheel is published to Test PyPI with the dev version

### Cocogitto Configuration

Cocogitto is configured via `.cog.toml` in the repository root. All `cog` commands must reference this config:

```bash
cog --config .cog.toml check                  # Validate commit messages
cog --config .cog.toml bump --auto --dry-run   # Preview next version
cog --config .cog.toml changelog               # Generate changelog
```

## Commit Signatures

We require that all commits are GPG-signed. This ensures commit authenticity and certifies your agreement with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) below.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not signed will not be accepted.

### Setting Up GPG Signing

1. **Generate a GPG key** (if you don't have one):
   See [GitHub: Generating a new GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)

2. **Add your GPG key to your GitHub account**:
   See [GitHub: Adding a GPG key to your account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)

3. **Configure Git to use your signing key**:

   ```bash
   # List your GPG keys to find your key ID
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

   # Configure Git with your key ID
   git config --global user.signingkey <your-key-id>

   # Enable automatic signing for all commits (recommended)
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   ```

### Signing Commits

If you haven't enabled automatic signing, use the `-S` flag:

```bash
git commit -S -m "feat: add cool feature"
```

Your commits will show as "Verified" on GitHub once properly configured.

### Developer Certificate of Origin
