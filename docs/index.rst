NCore
=====

NCore provides a canonical data specification, APIs, and tools for multi-sensor
recordings in robotics and autonomous vehicle applications. The format supports
NV-specific AV data (``NVIDIA Hyperion 8/8.1`` and future variants), robotics
platforms (``NVIDIA Carter``), as well as 3rd-party datasets like the
`Waymo Open Dataset <https://waymo.com/open/>`_.

NCore's latest :ref:`V4 component-based data format <v4-data-format>` enables
modular, independently-managed generic data components with flexible composition
and scalability.

The project is developed within the `NVIDIA SIL Lab <https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/>`_.
