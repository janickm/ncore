Argoverse 2 Dataset
===================

The NCore Argoverse 2 tool converts data from the
`Argoverse 2 <https://www.argoverse.org/av2.html>`_ Sensor Dataset into NCore
V4 format. The converter reads the Argoverse 2 on-disk Apache Feather files
directly with ``pyarrow`` and deliberately avoids the heavy ``av2`` devkit
(which pulls in torch, kornia, numba, polars and PyAV). The only additional
dependency is ``pyquaternion``.

.. _argoverse2_data_conventions:

Conventions
-----------

Argoverse 2 provides data from 9 cameras and 2 lidars; it has no radar. The
converter handles all sensor modalities and 3D cuboid annotations.

Camera Sensors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    1. **ring_front_center** -- 2048x1550 (portrait)
    2. **ring_front_left** -- 1550x2048
    3. **ring_front_right** -- 1550x2048
    4. **ring_side_left** -- 1550x2048
    5. **ring_side_right** -- 1550x2048
    6. **ring_rear_left** -- 1550x2048
    7. **ring_rear_right** -- 1550x2048
    8. **stereo_front_left** -- 1550x2048
    9. **stereo_front_right** -- 1550x2048

All nine cameras are global shutter and the released imagery is already
undistorted, so camera intrinsics are stored using
:class:`~ncore.data.OpenCVPinholeCameraModelParameters` with
``ShutterType.GLOBAL`` and zero distortion coefficients. The ``k1, k2, k3``
coefficients present in ``intrinsics.feather`` are intentionally ignored.

LiDAR Sensors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    1. **up_lidar** -- Velodyne VLP-32C, 32 beams, 10 Hz
    2. **down_lidar** -- Velodyne VLP-32C, 32 beams, 10 Hz

Argoverse 2 sweeps are egomotion-compensated to the sweep reference timestamp
and provided in the egovehicle frame, with real per-point timestamps
(``offset_ns``). The two stacked VLP-32C units are stored separately, each with
its own static extrinsic. Points are split per unit by ``laser_number``,
mapped into the unit's own sensor frame, and decompensated using the real
per-point timestamps so that NCore stores raw per-point-time ray directions.
Because the sensor extrinsic is static, this decompensation is independent of
whether the source data applied ego-motion before or after the sensor
transform.

No structured lidar model is stored in this version (``model_element`` is
``None``); a derived VLP-32C structured model can be added as a follow-up. The
``laser_number`` to up/down unit split is not documented by Argoverse 2. The two
units occupy the two laser-number halves (``< 32`` and ``>= 32``); the unit
*label* is recovered from extrinsic geometry by per-beam elevation flatness -- a
laser ring traces a constant-elevation cone only in its own sensor frame, so the
wrong extrinsic tilts the cone and inflates the per-ring elevation spread. The
decision is made once per log and is stable with a wide (~2-10x) margin.

Annotations
^^^^^^^^^^^

3D cuboid annotations are native to the egovehicle frame at the sweep reference
time. They are baked into the static ``world`` frame at conversion time using the
exact ego pose for that sweep. This is deliberate: the egovehicle moves up to
~1 m across a single ~100 ms sweep, so referencing cuboids to the dynamic ``rig``
frame would make their rendered position depend on how a consumer interpolates
the rig pose for a timestamp, appearing as a shift relative to the lidar. The
``track_uuid`` is used as the track ID.

Coordinate Frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first ego pose's ``city_SE3_egovehicle`` is stored as the static
``world -> world_global`` pose, so ``world_global`` is the Argoverse 2 city
frame. All absolute city coordinates remain recoverable for later alignment
with the Argoverse 2 HD map (which the converter does not export).
