Sensor Models
=============

NCore supports multiple sensor models for representing camera and lidar
intrinsics and distortion parameters. Each model provides different
parameterizations suited for various sensor types and use cases.


Camera Models
-------------

The following camera models are supported:

* :ref:`FTheta Camera Model <ftheta_camera_model>` - NVIDIA's FTheta camera
  model with polynomial distortion parameterization, suitable for both
  perspective and wide field-of-view cameras
* :ref:`Ideal Pinhole Camera Model <ideal_pinhole_camera_model>` - Efficient
  distortion-free pinhole camera model, also used as the target for
  :ref:`rectification <rectification>`
* :ref:`OpenCV Pinhole Camera Model <opencv_pinhole_camera_model>` - Standard
  pinhole camera model with rational radial, tangential, and thin prism
  distortion coefficients
* :ref:`OpenCV Fisheye Camera Model <opencv_fisheye_camera_model>` - OpenCV's
  fisheye camera model with polynomial distortion for ultra-wide angle and
  fisheye lenses
* :ref:`Ideal Orthographic Camera Model <ideal_orthographic_camera_model>` -
  Distortion-free parallel projection, e.g. for bird's-eye-view raster data

.. _central_and_non_central_models:

Central and Non-Central Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most camera models are **central**: every ray passes through a single centre of
projection, so a ray is fully described by a 3d direction and its origin is
implied by the sensor pose. The FTheta, ideal pinhole, OpenCV pinhole and OpenCV
fisheye models are all central.

The :ref:`ideal orthographic model <ideal_orthographic_camera_model>` is
**non-central**: its rays are parallel and share no common origin, so a
direction alone does not identify a ray. Its rays therefore carry an explicit
per-ray origin and are represented as 6d ``[origin, direction]``, matching the
layout of the world rays returned by
:meth:`~ncore.sensors.CameraModel.image_points_to_world_rays_static_pose`. See
:ref:`camera_ray_conventions`.

:attr:`~ncore.sensors.CameraModel.camera_ray_dim` reports which representation a
model uses (``3`` or ``6``). Note this concerns *unprojection* only:
:meth:`~ncore.sensors.CameraModel.camera_points_to_image_points` takes a 3d
camera-frame *point* for every model. A central model's projection is
scale-invariant, so any point along a ray (including a normalized direction)
projects identically; a non-central model's is not, so it must be given the
actual point. See :ref:`camera_ray_conventions`.

Two operations are unavailable for non-central models, because a parallel ray
bundle makes them ill-defined rather than merely unimplemented:

* **External distortion** deflects each ray individually, which would not
  preserve the parallel bundle. It is rejected when the model is constructed.
* **Rectification** against a central model has no depth-independent solution,
  since there is no common centre to pivot about. See :ref:`rectification`.

.. _camera_model_parameterizations:

Camera Model Parameterizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camera models may optionally include external distortion parameters to account for distortion sources outside the camera itself (e.g., windshields). See :ref:`external_distortion_models` for details.

The ``camera_model_parameters`` dictionary will unconditionally contain:

* ``resolution`` - width and height of the image in pixels (uint32, [2,])
* ``shutter_type`` - shutter type of the camera's imaging sensor (str, one of
  [ROLLING_TOP_TO_BOTTOM, ROLLING_LEFT_TO_RIGHT, ROLLING_BOTTOM_TO_TOP,
  ROLLING_RIGHT_TO_LEFT, GLOBAL])

.. _ftheta_camera_model:

FTheta Camera Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``camera_model_type = 'ftheta'`` the following intrinsic parameters
will additionally be available in ``camera_model_parameters``:

* ``principal_point`` - u and v coordinate of the principal point,
  following the NVIDIA default convention for FTheta camera models
  in which the pixel indices represent the center of the pixel
  (not the top-left corners). NOTE: principal point coordinates
  will be adapted internally in camera model APIs to reflect
  the :ref:`image coordinate conventions
  <image_coordinate_conventions>` (float32, [2,])

* ``reference_poly`` - indicating which of the two polynomials is the
  *reference* polynomial - the other polynomial is only an approximation
  of the inverse of the reference polynomial (str, one of
  [PIXELDIST_TO_ANGLE, ANGLE_TO_PIXELDIST])
* ``pixeldist_to_angle_poly`` - coefficients of the backward distortion
  polynomial (conditionally approximate, depending on
  ``reference_poly``), mapping pixel-distances to angles [rad] (float32,
  [6,])
* ``angle_to_pixeldist_poly`` - coefficients of the forward distortion
  polynomial (conditionally approximate, depending on
  ``reference_poly``), mapping angles [rad] to pixel-distances (float32,
  [6,])
* ``max_angle`` - maximal extrinsic ray angle [rad] with the principal
  direction (float32)
* ``linear_cde`` - Coefficients of the constrained linear term
  :math:`\begin{bmatrix} c & d \\ e & 1 \end{bmatrix}` transforming between
  sensor coordinates (in mm) to image coordinates (in px) (float32, [3,])

Mathematical Model
""""""""""""""""""

The FTheta model projects 3D camera rays to image coordinates through the following steps:

1. **Ray to Angle**: Convert camera ray direction [x, y, z] to angle θ:
   
   .. math::
   
      \theta = \arctan2(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, z)

2. **Angle to Pixel Distance**: Apply the forward polynomial f(θ):
   
   .. math::
   
      \delta = f(\theta) = c_0 + c_1\theta + c_2\theta^2 + c_3\theta^3 + c_4\theta^4 + c_5\theta^5

3. **Linear Transformation**: Apply constrained linear transformation A and add principal point:
   
   .. math::
   
      \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix} = 
      \begin{bmatrix} c & d \\ e & 1 \end{bmatrix}
      \frac{\delta}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}
      \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} + 
      \begin{bmatrix} u_0 \\ v_0 \end{bmatrix}

The inverse operation uses the backward polynomial (either reference or approximate inverse).

**Example:** For a typical FTheta model, both forward and backward polynomials contain 6 coefficients each (float32, [6,]).

.. _ideal_pinhole_camera_model:

Ideal Pinhole Camera Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``camera_model_type = 'ideal-pinhole'`` the following intrinsic parameters
will additionally be available in ``camera_model_parameters``:

* ``principal_point`` - u and v coordinate of the principal point,
  following the :ref:`image coordinate conventions
  <image_coordinate_conventions>` (float32, [2,])
* ``focal_length`` - focal lengths in u and v direction, resp., mapping
  normalized camera coordinates to image coordinates relative to the
  principal point (float32, [2,])

Mathematical Model
""""""""""""""""""

The ideal pinhole model is a distortion-free perspective projection. It is the
most efficient camera model (no distortion polynomial evaluation, no iterative
undistortion) and the natural target for :ref:`rectification <rectification>`.

1. **Normalize**: Convert camera ray ``[x, y, z]`` to normalized coordinates:

   .. math::

      x' = \frac{x}{z}, \quad y' = \frac{y}{z}

2. **Project to Image**: Apply focal length and principal point:

   .. math::

      \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix} =
      \begin{bmatrix} f_u x' + u_0 \\ f_v y' + v_0 \end{bmatrix}

Unprojection is the closed-form inverse :math:`x' = (u - u_0) / f_u`,
:math:`y' = (v - v_0) / f_v`, followed by normalization of ``[x', y', 1]``.

.. note::

   An :ref:`OpenCV Pinhole <opencv_pinhole_camera_model>` whose distortion
   coefficients are all zero (and which carries no external distortion) is
   equivalent to an ideal pinhole and is evaluated through the same closed-form
   path internally. The ``ideal-pinhole`` and ``opencv-pinhole`` model types are
   *siblings*: an OpenCV pinhole is **not** an instance of an ideal pinhole.

.. _opencv_pinhole_camera_model:

OpenCV Pinhole Camera Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``camera_model_type = 'opencv-pinhole'`` the following intrinsic parameters

* ``focal_length`` - focal lengths in u and v direction, resp., mapping
  (distorted) normalized camera coordinates to image coordinates relative
  to the principal point (float32, [2,])
* ``radial_coeffs`` - radial distortion coefficients

  + k_6r^6}` for squared norms :math:`r^2` of normalized camera
  coordinates (float32, [6,])
* ``tangential_coeffs`` - tangential distortion coefficients ``[p1,p2]``
  parameterizing the tangential distortion components
  :math:`\begin{bmatrix} 2p_1x'y' + p_2 \left(r^2 + 2{x'}^2 \right) \\
  p_1 \left(r^2 + 2{y'}^2 \right) + 2p_2x'y' \end{bmatrix}` for
  normalized camera coordinates :math:`\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y'
  \end{bmatrix}` (float32, [2,])
* ``thin_prism_coeffs`` - thins prism distortion coefficients
  ``[s1,s2,s3,s4]`` parameterizing the thin prism distortion components
  :math:`\begin{bmatrix} s_1r^2 + s_2r^4 \\ s_3r^2 + s_4r^4
  \end{bmatrix}` for squared norms :math:`r^2` of normalized camera
  coordinates (float32, [4,])

Mathematical Model
""""""""""""""""""

The OpenCV Pinhole model applies radial, tangential, and thin prism distortions:

1. **Normalize**: Convert camera ray [x, y, z] to normalized coordinates:
   
   .. math::
   
      x' = \frac{x}{z}, \quad y' = \frac{y}{z}, \quad r^2 = {x'}^2 + {y'}^2

2. **Radial Distortion**: Apply rational radial distortion factor:
   
   .. math::
   
      d_r = \frac{1 + k_1r^2 + k_2r^4 + k_3r^6}{1 + k_4r^2 + k_5r^4 + k_6r^6}

3. **Tangential Distortion**:
   
   .. math::
   
      \begin{bmatrix} \Delta x_t \\ \Delta y_t \end{bmatrix} = 
      \begin{bmatrix} 
      2p_1x'y' + p_2(r^2 + 2{x'}^2) \\ 
      p_1(r^2 + 2{y'}^2) + 2p_2x'y' 
      \end{bmatrix}

4. **Thin Prism Distortion**:
   
   .. math::
   
      \begin{bmatrix} \Delta x_p \\ \Delta y_p \end{bmatrix} = 
      \begin{bmatrix} 
      s_1r^2 + s_2r^4 \\ 
      s_3r^2 + s_4r^4 
      \end{bmatrix}

5. **Project to Image**: Apply focal length and principal point:
   
   .. math::
   
      \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix} = 
      \begin{bmatrix} f_u(x'd_r + \Delta x_t + \Delta x_p) + u_0 \\ 
      f_v(y'd_r + \Delta y_t + \Delta y_p) + v_0 \end{bmatrix}

**Example:** Typical parameter sizes: radial_coeffs [6,], tangential_coeffs [2,], thin_prism_coeffs [4,], all float32.

.. _opencv_fisheye_camera_model:

OpenCV Fisheye Camera Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``camera_model_type = 'opencv-fisheye'`` the following intrinsic parameters
will additionally be available in ``camera_model_parameters``:

* ``principal_point`` - u and v coordinate of the principal point,
  following the :ref:`image coordinate conventions
  <image_coordinate_conventions>` (float32, [2,])
* ``focal_length`` - focal lengths in u and v direction, resp., mapping
  (distorted) normalized camera coordinates to image coordinates relative
  to the principal point (float32, [2,])
* ``radial_coeffs`` - radial distortion coefficients representing
  OpenCV-style ``[k1,k2,k3,k4]`` parameters of the
  fisheye distortion polynomial :math:`\theta(1 + k_1\theta^2 +
  k_2\theta^4 + k_3\theta^6 + k_4\theta^8)` for extrinsic camera ray
  angles :math:`\theta` with the principal direction (float32, [4,])
* ``max_angle`` - maximal extrinsic ray angle [rad] with the principal
  direction (float32)

Mathematical Model
""""""""""""""""""

The OpenCV Fisheye model uses a fisheye distortion polynomial:

1. **Ray to Angle**: Convert camera ray direction [x, y, z] to angle θ and normalized direction:
   
   .. math::
   
      \theta = \arctan2(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, z)
   
   .. math::
   
      x_n = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}, \quad y_n = \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}

2. **Fisheye Distortion Polynomial**: Apply distortion to angle:
   
   .. math::
   
      \delta(\theta) = \theta(1 + k_1\theta^2 + k_2\theta^4 + k_3\theta^6 + k_4\theta^8)

3. **Project to Image**: Scale by focal length and add principal point:
   
   .. math::
   
      \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix} = 
      \begin{bmatrix} f_u \delta(\theta) x_n + u_0 \\ 
      f_v \delta(\theta) y_n + v_0 \end{bmatrix}

The inverse operation uses Newton-Raphson iteration to invert the ninth-degree polynomial. **Example:** The radial_coeffs parameter contains [k₁, k₂, k₃, k₄] (float32, [4,]).

.. _ideal_orthographic_camera_model:

Ideal Orthographic Camera Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``camera_model_type = 'ideal-orthographic'`` the following intrinsic
parameters will additionally be available in ``camera_model_parameters``:

* ``principal_point`` - u and v coordinate of the principal point,
  following the :ref:`image coordinate conventions
  <image_coordinate_conventions>` (float32, [2,])
* ``pixels_per_unit`` - image scale in u and v direction, resp., in pixels per
  scene unit, mapping camera coordinates to image coordinates relative to the
  principal point. Must be positive (float32, [2,])

Mathematical Model
""""""""""""""""""

The ideal orthographic model is a distortion-free *parallel* projection: the
camera-frame depth is dropped rather than divided by, so a point's image
location does not depend on it.

**Project to Image**: Scale the camera-frame coordinates and add the principal
point:

.. math::

   \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix} =
   \begin{bmatrix} s_u x + u_0 \\ s_v y + v_0 \end{bmatrix}

Unprojection is the closed-form inverse :math:`x = (u - u_0) / s_u`,
:math:`y = (v - v_0) / s_v`, giving a ray *origin* :math:`[x, y, 0]` on the
camera frame's :math:`z = 0` plane. Every ray shares the principal direction
:math:`[0, 0, 1]`, so unprojection returns 6d ``[origin, direction]`` rays (see
:ref:`central_and_non_central_models`).

``pixels_per_unit`` occupies the same place in the projection as a pinhole's
``focal_length``, but differs in dimension: a pinhole consumes the dimensionless
:math:`x/z` and so is measured in pixels, whereas this model consumes
:math:`x` directly and is therefore measured in pixels per scene unit (meters
for metric sequences; see the ``coordinate_unit`` field in
:ref:`data_formats`). An orthographic camera's focal length is infinite, which
is why it has no pinhole approximation and cannot be rectified to one.

.. note::

   Because a parallel projection has no frustum, validity is purely the
   in-image test. Unlike the pinhole models there is **no** "in front of the
   camera" (:math:`z > 0`) check: points behind the :math:`z = 0` plane project
   exactly like points in front of it.

The intrinsics can equivalently be read as the axis-aligned metric *window* the
camera views, which is the form consumers working in normalized image
coordinates (e.g. bird's-eye-view feature maps) tend to want.
:meth:`~ncore.data.IdealOrthographicCameraModelParameters.window_min` and
:meth:`~ncore.data.IdealOrthographicCameraModelParameters.window_max` convert to
it, and
:meth:`~ncore.data.IdealOrthographicCameraModelParameters.from_window`
constructs from it:

.. math::

   \text{window\_min} = -\frac{\text{principal\_point}}{\text{pixels\_per\_unit}},
   \quad
   \text{window\_max} = \frac{\text{resolution} - \text{principal\_point}}{\text{pixels\_per\_unit}}

.. note::

   Being distortion-free, this model is the orthographic counterpart of the
   :ref:`ideal pinhole <ideal_pinhole_camera_model>`. A real object-side
   telecentric lens additionally has image-plane radial distortion; such a
   model would be a *sibling* of this one, the way ``opencv-pinhole`` is a
   sibling of ``ideal-pinhole``.

.. _external_distortion_models:

External Distortion Models
--------------------------

Camera models can optionally include external distortion sources that affect rays before they reach the camera lens (e.g., windshields). If present, the ``camera_model_parameters`` dictionary will contain:

* ``external_distortion_parameters`` - parameters for the external distortion model (optional, may be None)

When ``external_distortion_parameters`` is present, it will contain:

* ``external_distortion_type`` - type of external distortion (str)

.. note::

   External distortion is only defined for :ref:`central
   <central_and_non_central_models>` camera models. It deflects every ray
   individually, which would not map a parallel ray bundle to another parallel
   one, so attaching it to a non-central model (e.g. the :ref:`ideal
   orthographic <ideal_orthographic_camera_model>` one) raises at construction.

.. _bivariate_windshield_model:

Bivariate Windshield Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``external_distortion_type = 'bivariate-windshield'``, this models optical distortion caused by a vehicle's windshield. This model is only applicable when the camera's entire field of view projects through the windshield.

Mathematical Model
""""""""""""""""""

The distortion operates on spherical angle representations of sensor rays with direction [x, y, z]:

1. **Convert to Spherical Angles**:
   
   .. math::
   
      \phi = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\right) \quad \text{(horizontal angle)}
   
   .. math::
   
      \theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\right) \quad \text{(vertical angle)}

2. **Apply Bivariate Polynomial Distortion**:
   
   Distortion is applied via separate polynomials for horizontal and vertical components:
   
   .. math::
   
      \phi' = P_h(\phi, \theta)
   
   .. math::
   
      \theta' = P_v(\phi, \theta)
   
   Where each polynomial has the bivariate form (example for order N=2):
   
   .. math::
   
      P(\phi, \theta) = c_0 + c_1\phi + c_2\phi^2 + (c_3 + c_4\phi)\theta + c_5\theta^2
   
   General form for order N:
   
   .. math::
   
      P(\phi, \theta) = \sum_{j=0}^{N} \left(\sum_{i=0}^{N-j} c_{i,j}\phi^i\right)\theta^j

3. **Reconstruct Distorted Ray**:
   
   .. math::
   
      [x', y', z'] = \left[\sin(\phi'), \sin(\theta'), \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(\phi') - \sin^2(\theta')}\right]

Parameters
""""""""""

The following parameters will be available in ``external_distortion_parameters``:

* ``reference_poly`` - indicates which polynomial is the reference (str, one of [FORWARD, BACKWARD]). The reference polynomial is exact; the other is an approximate inverse computed during calibration.
* ``horizontal_poly`` - coefficients for forward horizontal distortion polynomial P_h (float32, [(N+1)·(N+2)/2,])
* ``vertical_poly`` - coefficients for forward vertical distortion polynomial P_v (float32, [(M+1)·(M+2)/2,])
* ``horizontal_poly_inverse`` - coefficients for backward horizontal distortion (float32, [(N+1)·(N+2)/2,])
* ``vertical_poly_inverse`` - coefficients for backward vertical distortion (float32, [(M+1)·(M+2)/2,])

**Example:** For a 2nd-order bivariate polynomial (N=2), the coefficient arrays contain 6 elements: [c₀, c₁, c₂, c₃, c₄, c₅]. For a 3rd-order polynomial (N=3), they contain 10 elements. The number of coefficients for order N is given by: (N+1)·(N+2)/2

Direction
"""""""""

- **Forward distortion** (distort_camera_rays): transforms rays from external (world) to internal (camera sensor)
- **Backward distortion** (undistort_camera_rays): transforms rays from internal (camera sensor) to external (world)


.. _rectification:

Rectification
-------------

Rectification maps imagery from a *source* camera into a *target* camera's image
domain. It is a generic "from-camera -> to-camera" intrinsic remap within a
shared camera frame; the most common use is mapping a distorted source camera to
a distortion-free :ref:`ideal pinhole <ideal_pinhole_camera_model>` target, but
the target may itself be distorted.

.. note::

   Both cameras must use the same ray representation (see
   :ref:`central_and_non_central_models`). Rectifying between a central and a
   non-central model is ill-posed: with no common projection centre to pivot
   about, the correspondence between the two image domains depends on the depth
   of whatever is being viewed, so there is no single depth-independent remap.
   Rectification between two non-central models is well-defined but not
   implemented yet.

Deriving an ideal target
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :meth:`IdealPinholeCameraModelParameters.from_source(source, target_fov=None)
<ncore.data.IdealPinholeCameraModelParameters.from_source>`
factory builds an :ref:`ideal pinhole <ideal_pinhole_camera_model>` approximating
any supported source camera. It extracts the source's paraxial pinhole geometry
(focal length, principal point, resolution), preserving the source focal aspect
ratio:

* Ideal / OpenCV pinhole / OpenCV fisheye: the model's own ``focal_length``
  (anisotropic ``fx != fy`` preserved; OpenCV pinhole distortion is dropped).
* FTheta: the first-order coefficient of the angles-to-pixeldistances (forward)
  polynomial scaled by the linear term, i.e. ``[c1 * c, c1]`` with
  :math:`c_1 = \mathrm{angle\_to\_pixeldist\_poly}[1]` and
  :math:`c = \mathrm{linear\_cde}[0]`, since
  :math:`\mathrm{d}\,\delta/\mathrm{d}\theta|_{\theta=0} = c_1` and
  :math:`r = f\tan\theta \approx f\theta` near :math:`\theta = 0` (the linear
  term's shear components are not representable by a pinhole and are dropped).

The ``target_fov`` argument selects the angular extent of the rectified pinhole
as a *full* field-of-view angle [rad]:

* ``None``: use the source's natural field of view (the paraxial focal). A
  pinhole focal always yields a field of view strictly below 180 degrees, so for
  wide fisheye / omnidirectional cameras this is a narrow rectilinear *central
  window* of the captured scene.
* ``float``: an isotropic target full field of view, preserving the source focal
  aspect ratio (the most binding image axis lands exactly at this value).
* ``np.ndarray`` of shape ``[2,]``: per-axis target full field of view
  ``[fov_x, fov_y]``.

``target_fov`` selects *which rays* the pinhole covers, not a magnification:
because a pinhole maps angle to pixel distance as :math:`r = f\tan\theta`,
different values yield genuinely different views (the periphery stretches
increasingly for wider fields of view; the optical axis stays fixed). Widening
past the source's captured field of view is allowed and yields invalid
(out-of-source) regions, which the :class:`~ncore.sensors.Rectificator` zeroes.
:meth:`~ncore.data.IdealPinholeCameraModelParameters.from_source` raises
``ValueError`` if a requested field of view cannot be represented by a pinhole
(any axis at or beyond 180 degrees), and ``TypeError`` for an unsupported source
model.

Use :meth:`IdealPinholeCameraModelParameters.natural_fov(source)
<ncore.data.IdealPinholeCameraModelParameters.natural_fov>` (per-axis full FOV
``np.ndarray``) to discover a sensible value to scale, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from ncore.data import IdealPinholeCameraModelParameters
   from ncore.sensors import Rectificator, camera_model_from_parameters

   source_params = source_model.get_parameters()

   # Default rectification (source's natural field of view)
   target_params = IdealPinholeCameraModelParameters.from_source(source_params)

   # Widen by 20% (e.g. to recover more of a wide lens) or set an explicit FOV
   target_params = IdealPinholeCameraModelParameters.from_source(
       source_params, target_fov=1.2 * IdealPinholeCameraModelParameters.natural_fov(source_params)
   )
   target_params = IdealPinholeCameraModelParameters.from_source(source_params, target_fov=np.radians(90.0))

   target = camera_model_from_parameters(target_params)
   rect = Rectificator(source_model, target)

Rectificator
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :class:`~ncore.sensors.Rectificator` is constructed from a
source/target :class:`~ncore.sensors.CameraModel` pair and builds a backward sample map
(target -> source) once:

1. each target pixel is unprojected to a ray with the target model,
2. the ray is re-projected to a source image coordinate with the source model.

It exposes:

* ``sample_map`` - ``[H, W, 2]`` source image coordinates to sample for each
  target pixel (usable directly with custom / GPU / OpenCV resampling).
* ``valid_mask`` - ``[H, W]`` boolean mask of target pixels whose ray projects
  inside the source image.
* ``apply(image, mode="bilinear", padding_mode="zeros")`` - resamples a source
  image (``[H, W]``, ``[H, W, C]`` or ``[N, H, W, C]``, channels-last) into the
  target domain, zeroing invalid pixels. ``mode`` selects the interpolation
  (``"bilinear"``, ``"nearest"`` or ``"bicubic"``) and ``padding_mode`` the
  out-of-bounds sampling behaviour (``"zeros"``, ``"border"`` or
  ``"reflection"``); both are forwarded to ``torch.nn.functional.grid_sample``.
* ``source_points_to_target(points)`` / ``target_points_to_source(points)`` -
  map sparse continuous image points between the two cameras.


Lidar Models
------------

NCore supports the following lidar models:

* :ref:`Row-Offset Structured Spinning Lidar <row_offset_spinning_lidar_model>`
  - Structured spinning lidar model with per-row azimuth offsets (compatible
  with sensors like Hesai P128)

The ``lidar_model_parameters`` dictionary contains model-specific parameters for lidar sensors. Currently, the supported model type is ``row-offset-spinning``.

.. _row_offset_spinning_lidar_model:

Row-Offset Structured Spinning Lidar Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``lidar_model_type = 'row-offset-spinning'``, this models structured spinning lidar sensors with per-row azimuth offsets (compatible with sensors like Hesai P128).

Mathematical Model
""""""""""""""""""

The Row-Offset Structured Spinning Lidar model parameterizes lidar returns using per-row elevation angles and per-column azimuth angles with row-specific offsets.

Notation
""""""""

- α (alpha): elevation angle in radians
- β (beta): azimuth angle in radians
- E: row_elevations_rad array - elevation angles per row
- B: column_azimuths_rad array - base azimuth angles per column
- Δ (Delta): row_azimuth_offsets_rad array - azimuth offsets per row (optional, can be zero if no row offsets)
- i: row index
- j: column index

1. **Element to Angles**: For element (i, j):
   
   .. math::
   
      \alpha = E[i]
   
   .. math::
   
      \beta = B[j] + \Delta[i]

2. **Angles to Sensor Ray**: Convert spherical angles to 3D ray direction:
   
   .. math::
   
      x = \cos(\beta) \cdot \cos(\alpha)
   
   .. math::
   
      y = \sin(\beta) \cdot \cos(\alpha)
   
   .. math::
   
      z = \sin(\alpha)

3. **Sensor Ray to Angles**: Convert 3D ray [x, y, z] to angles:
   
   .. math::
   
      \alpha = \arcsin(z)
   
   .. math::
   
      \beta = \arctan2(y, x)

Parameters
""""""""""

The following parameters will be available in ``lidar_model_parameters``:

* ``row_elevations_rad`` - elevation angle for each row (float32, [n_rows,])
* ``column_azimuths_rad`` - base azimuth angle for each column (float32, [n_columns,])
* ``row_azimuth_offsets_rad`` - azimuth offset for each row (float32, [n_rows,])
* ``spinning_frequency_hz`` - rotation frequency in Hz (float32)
* ``spinning_direction`` - rotation direction (str, one of ['cw', 'ccw'])
* ``n_rows`` - number of vertical laser channels (int)
* ``n_columns`` - number of azimuth divisions per revolution (int)

**Example:** A Hesai P128 lidar would have n_rows=128 (for 128 laser channels), with row_elevations_rad containing 128 elevation angles and row_azimuth_offsets_rad containing 128 azimuth offsets.
